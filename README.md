## 📊 HR Attrition Analysis

This project explores a real-world HR dataset to uncover the main factors driving employee attrition.  
Using **SQL for querying**, **Python for data exploration**, and **Power BI for storytelling**, we analyze job roles, age groups, overtime, satisfaction levels, and more — helping HR teams make smarter, data-backed retention decisions.
